# Information
[SimpleScore][GitHub] is a powerful yet easy-to-use plugin that lets you bring your Minecraft server to life with fully customized scoreboards. Display key information, announcements, player stats and much more in real-time!

Supports selecting and showing specific scoreboards to players based on their permissions, certain conditions, the current world, or even the [WorldGuard][WorldGuard] region they are inside with a very simple and intuitive configuration system.

Also comes with support for [PlaceholderAPI][PlaceholderAPI], allowing you to hook into thousands of other plugins to retrieve and display their information in real time, or create a set of conditions that the player must meet to be able to see a particular scoreboard.

## Main Features
- A lag-free, fully animated scoreboard with no flickering
- Support for newer features such as hiding score numbers
- Full RGB colour support on 1.16 servers or newer
- Supports all major Minecraft versions from 1.8.x to 1.21.x
- Can display scoreboards based on permissions, conditions, worlds and regions
- No character limit on 1.13 servers or newer (limited to 32 characters on older versions)
- Should be compatible with any other plugins that temporarily change the scoreboard
- Any message sent by the plugin can be modified either by the built-in translation system or by providing a custom messages file
